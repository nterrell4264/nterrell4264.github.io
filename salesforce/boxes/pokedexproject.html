	<p>A project that showcases the power of Salesforce by compiling all over 1000 Pokémon data into a public-facing website. 
	This includes the large details like evolution and alternate form data, the small details like what color and shape they are in the Pokédex, and the details beyond the Pokémon themselves,
	like over 800 moves and the map of each Pokémon to the dozens of moves it learns, among other information, for over 85,000 traversible relationships.
	The end result is a database that is lightweight and easily naviagble (unlike the main wiki Bulbapedia) and comprehensive in scale (unlike the Pokémon Showdown! battle simulator, which only has battle-relevant information).</p>
	<p>This project is so large that Salesforce's data storage limit has, sadly, curtailed its complete actualization from its design. The Pokédex experience thus displays only a subset of the described information.</p>

	<p>This information was compiled from Pokémon Showdown!, Bulbapedia, and custom spreadsheets where needed, then translated into Salesforce-importable data by a Python script I created.
	It is also based off of my Pokémon Earth & Sky expansion, which curtails much of what would be a long tail of moves and Abilities connected to only one Pokémon 
	due to the franchise's recent design decisions, making the information more easily navigable.</p>

	<h1>YVSC Volunteering</h1>
	<p>In fall of 2024, I performed Salesforce work for the Yampa Valley Sustainability Council non-profit organization utilizing the Non Profit Success Pack. 
	We met weekly to demo my changes and get approval before deploying them; utilizing best practices, all of my changes were performed in a sandbox and then pushed to production using change sets.</p>
	<p> I was supervised in this project by my older brother, who has seven years of Salesforce experience.</p>

	<p>The bulk of project was setting up an integration between Salesforce and Mailchimp to connect donors and event attendees with their correspondence, 
	saving hour-long processes manually synching contact data. This included installing and configuring the Mailchimp for Salesforce Package with further 
	add-ons such as a Flow to ensure the data is mapped completely and in line with how YVSC is using their Salesforce instance.</p>

	<p>Additionally, I fixed several bugs with the setup and wrote Apex classes utilizing Batchable Apex to clean hundreds of records in the org's data and help prevent duplicates.</p>

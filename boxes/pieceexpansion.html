	<p>A game mod I made for <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i>. One of the game's three playstyles requires finding three randomly selected collectibles in an open, 3D environment.
	The collectibles are not randomly generated, however; they are selected from pre-created locations stored in the game's files.</p>
	<img src="../images/seteditor.png" alt="Some collectible locations within an object file." />
	<p>Each location is represented by an object within the level's object file, called the setfile. The object contains an ID for the piece (on the X Rotation), 
	which determines several factors such as which of the three slots it can fill and whether it needs to be unearthed. 
	It is also used to link the location with a set of three hints to help find it, which are located in another file.</p>
	<p>The mod edits these files, creating new pieces in place of ones that are repeated or left unused in the files.</p>
	<p>It has been released to the public and playtested. The video clip above is from when two respected speedrunners of the game did a race with the mod.</p>

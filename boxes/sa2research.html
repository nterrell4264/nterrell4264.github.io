	<h1>Sonic Adventure 2: Reverse Engineering Level Objects and the Hunting Algorithm</h1>

	<p>In creating the Piece Expansion Mod and in pursuing my hobby of speedrunning the game, I had to disect first the way the game reads its object files. 
	Previously, people had made tools to extract the data, and discovered the general structure of an object: 
	Three floats for location, three hexadecimal values commonly used for rotation, and three floats commonly used for scale.
	However, I was the first person to play with the values to discover what they actually change about each particular object type.

	I've documented my work on a public spreadsheet as a reference for other modders-to-be.</a></p>
	<p>One of the game's three playstyles requires finding three randomly selected collectibles in an open, 3D environment.
	The collectibles are not randomly generated, however; they are selected from pre-created locations stored in these same files. 
	The game does so using a mathematical algorithm, and I coded a tool in C# that recreates the algorithm and records results from any step of the process, 
	<a href="../downloads/Combo Calculator.zip" download>available for download here</a>.
	I've compiled all of that data into another set of spreadsheets, 
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RW00L3s5yO7mS6Cf8DkzT8poYZKVW4Fl?usp=sharing">which is also publicly available.</a></p>
	<p>Using the object data, I've also begun working on making maps of each level, starting with the one at the top. This is going to be a collaborative project,
	as game designer <a href="http://mbarbier.wixsite.com/portfolio">Magali Barbier</a> has taken an interest in making even more detailed maps and analyzing level design choices.</p>

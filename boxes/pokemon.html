	<h1>Pokémon Earth & Sky</h1>

	<p>One of my longest-running projects is design and documentation for a hypothetical set of Pokémon games, if I were to design them. The document includes
	a new region based on Greece, over 100 new Pokémon and forms (with fully-defined stats, movepools, PokéDex entries, the whole nine yards), a filled dex of 
	other included Pokémon in the region, and much more.</p>

	<p>Battles with these additions and the many, many changes made to existing content are <u>playable</u>, having been fully coded by me in TypeScript to the largest 
	Pokémon battle simulator, <i>Pokémon Showdown!</i>. Teams can be built and battled with on <a href="https://dragonheaven.herokuapp.com/">the Dragon Heaven server</a>,
	though I recommend having a strong familiarity with the Pokémon battle system to be able to understand what's going on.</p>

	<p>Along with the raw spreadsheets, I am working on a website that presents many of the additions and changes with more detail, including commentary from myself
	on the design process and the reasoning behind my decisions. Both are linked below.</p>

	</ul>
	<p>The reason I am showing it on my portfolio is to show off my design skills, thought processes, and my passion and dedication to projects I enjoy.
	Putting the rest of the project into production, either on my own using one of the many Pokémon-game-making-kits out there, or in some distant future somehow 
	proposing it to the Pokémon Company, will probably never happen. This is a AAA series we're talking about, after all.</p>

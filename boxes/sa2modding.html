	<h1>Sonic Adventure 2 Modding</h1>
	<p>Since 2016, I have been a pioneer of the modding scene for the PC version of <i>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</i>. I have completed several of these mods, 
	all of which were released to good acclaim, and every one focuses on editing the game's levels to improve them in some fashion.</p>
	<a href="https://gamebanana.com/members/submissions/gamefiles/1720449" target="__blank">Use this link to visit the public releases of my mods.</a>
	<p>The process of creating these mods primarily involves using a level data editor, along with a C++ DLL for more technical changes. If you're interested 
	in my skill in these programming/engineering aspects, see the SA2 Research portfolio piece. Below, I shall highlight my two greatest projects.</p>
	
	<h2>Super Hard Mode</h2>
	<p><b>Super Hard Mode</b> builds on the game's existent Hard Mode, which edits the normal levels to add extra challenges. I was involved in the game's speedrunning 
	scene for several years, and even the Hard Mode ceases to be much of a challenge at the skill level needed to be a decent speedrunner. Armed with this knowledge, 
	I thoroughly analyze every part of the level and create challenges that require mastery of the controls and utilize the maximum extent of what the game 
	has to offer. There's a surprising amount of object functionality that the game can run without error but never utilizes.</p>

	<h2>Piece Expansion Mod</h2>
	<p>One of the game's three playstyles requires finding three randomly selected collectibles in an open, 3D environment.
	The collectibles, known to the community as pieces, are not randomly generated, however; they are selected from pre-created locations stored in the game's files. 
	Each location is themed on a specific asset in the stage, which becomes identifiable by a set of hints specific to that collectible.</p>

	<p>The Piece Expansion mod overwrites some of these locations, as the creation of new ones is not currently possible, to brand new ones. 
	There are many sets of locations that are near-identical to each other, and some that are unused, and I targeted these ones to diversify the selection as much as possible. 
	This required careful analysis of both the finest details and the greater piece distribution in each stage, so that I could find the most meaningful locations for new pieces</p>

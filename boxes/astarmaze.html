	<h1>A* Maze Solver</h1>
	<p>In this project, I worked with a partner to implement the A* pathfinding algorithm in C++ to use in a maze program. My main responsibility was coding the algorithm. 
	I did so by recursively calling the function that determines the shortest path - it finds it by comparing the shortest paths found by each of the adjacent, unvisited notes.</p>

	<h1>Grim Gallery</h1>
	<p>A Virtual Reality game set in an abandoned mansion, where the player must solve the puzzles of the mansion to find a hidden treasure.
	This game was designed and programmed by a team of RIT students, and it was quality enough to be showcased in RIT's annual Imagine RIT event.</p>

	<p>However, my role in its production was actually as the game's composer. I made a total of 11 tracks for the game, which are variants of a spooky theme tailored to fit different areas of the mansion.
	I used Ableton 9 to create the tracks, which allowed me to test the seamless transitions they have between each other as the player traverses the mansion.</p>

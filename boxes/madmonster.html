	<p>Mad Monster Ring is a card game created as a group project for one of my university classes. Up to four players duke it out in a free-for-all battle 
	using monsters they stitch together from parts they draw randomly!</p>

	<p>Creating this game was a rigorous process. The members of our group collectively brainstormed 64 unique cards, across four slots and elements, which 
	we then balanced over many rounds of testing both within the group and by getting others to play.</p>

	<h1>Crypt Project - 3D Modelling</h1>
	<img src="../images/CryptPreview2.png" alt="" />
	<p>A modelling project with a group. Everyone made assets in Maya and imported them into Unity. My contribution was modelling the hallways the game takes place in. 
	I created them as segments that all can connect modularly, and I arranged the level map and put it all together in the Unity scene.</p>

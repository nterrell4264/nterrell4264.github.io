	<p>A serious geogame created by the Geographic Information Systems for Disaster Resilience Spatial Thinking Site, 
	an interdisciplinary team of academics and game developers funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.
	As part of the project, our team authored a research paper detailing its goals, methods, and effectiveness,
	<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/405/htm" target="__blank">which has since been published in the International Journal of Geo-Information.</a>

	<p>My role was to design the game based on the background research we had conducted on geogames, game-based learning, and the concepts of disaster resilience and spatial thinking that we aimed to teach.
	I also helped create the UI and find assets to use as landmarks. We created the game using Unity, and our map was made by importing real-world geographic 
	data from OpenStreetMap through the use of ArcGIS, Mapbox, and CityEngine.</p>

	<p>The game takes place in Dickinson, TX, as it floods during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Players are tasked with helping people in need as a volunteer, 
	navigating the city with only a map and learning about the real-world techniques used in preparedness and response. The purpose of these activities 
	is to teach players spatial thinking and disaster resilience, skills identified as lacking in disaster relief scenarios.</p>

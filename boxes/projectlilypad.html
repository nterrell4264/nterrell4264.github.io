	<p>A serious geogame created by the Geographic Information Systems for Disaster Resilience Spatial Thinking Site, 
	an interdisciplinary team funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. 
	My role was to design the game based on the background research that was conducted, and I helped create the UI and find assets to use as landmarks.</p>

	<p>In this game, the player must navigate Dickinson, TX, as it floods during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Our map was made by importing real-world geographic data from OpenStreetMap through the use of ArcGIS, Mapbox, and CityEngine.</p>
	<p>The game's purpose is to teach the player spatial thinking by navigating with only a map, and disaster resilience by introducing the real-world techniques used in preparedness and response.</p>

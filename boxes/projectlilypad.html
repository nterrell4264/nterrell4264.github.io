	<p>A serious geogame created by the Geographic Information Systems for Disaster Resilience Spatial Thinking Site, 
	an interdisciplinary team funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The game was created as part of a research paper 
	<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/405/htm">which has since been published in the International Journal of Geo-Information.</a>
	It has also been

	<p>My role was to design the game based on the background research we had conducted on geogames, game-based learning, and the concepts of disaster resilience and spatial thinking that we aimed to teach.
	I also helped create the UI and find assets to use as landmarks.</p>

	<p>In this game, the player must navigate Dickinson, TX, as it floods during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Our map was made by importing real-world geographic data from OpenStreetMap through the use of ArcGIS, Mapbox, and CityEngine.</p>
	<p>The game's purpose is to teach the player spatial thinking by navigating with only a map, and disaster resilience by introducing the real-world techniques used in preparedness and response.</p>

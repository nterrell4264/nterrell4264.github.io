	<h1>Fiction Writing</h1>
	<p>I write stories based on video games and other literature in my free time. I have also taken a writing course while at the university.
	Cumulatively, I've written over 60,000 words and have gotten over 100 favorites and 160 followers on my stories.
	Below are some excerpts from my stories:</p>

	<h2>From <i>The Legacy of Mann</i>, Chapter 10</h2>
	<p>Scout's heart skipped a beat when he heard a new voice from behind him. "Boring? I thought you loved killing people?" it said. He could recognize Tracer's sexy accent anywhere. Time to get his charm on. He ran his right hand through his hair real quickly and spun on his heels to see Tracer stretching in the doorway.</p>
	<p>"'Sup, sweetcheeks. Couldn't resist saying hi to your favorite new compadre?"</p>
	<p>Tracer laughed. "Ha! I wouldn't be down here, especially with <i>you</i>, if I had anything better to do in this base. No excursions allowed while we're gearing up for a mission, though, so I thought I'd come relieve my boredom with a little game."</p>
	<p>"A game?" The Scout grabbed his baseball from his magic pocket and tossed it in the air. "You wanna play ball?"</p>
	<p>"Maybe later. I guess exercise is the better word for what I want to do. Basically, you and I compete to see who can hit more targets in a certain amount of time."</p>
	<p>"Alright, I'm down. How long will I be kicking your ass for?"</p>
	<p>"Oh, you think you're clever? I'm gonna send you home with your tail between ya legs. Let's say… five minutes, starting now. Cheers!" she exclaimed, blinking away immediately to get a head start.</p>
	<p>"H-hey!" he exclaimed, taking a moment to register what just happened. <i>So that's how you wanna play? It's go time, tuts.</i></p>

	<h2>From <i>The Price</i> (short story)</h2>
	<p>The casino shone like a beacon in contrast to the green around it. Every outline of the building was lined with lights, as if there were a halo 
	coming from within the building at all times. Spotlights of various colors but always high intensity focused on the entrance and the flashy logo, 
	which was also made of light-up signs. It glowed like it was daytime.</p>
	<p>The brightness did obnoxiously good job at selling an image. Where else would one find such endless light but a paradise? It’s a good time, 
	a good decision, it must be! Jim admitted that he had some fun there, but it was social fun. It was sitting around, joking it up with Hank and 
	his buddies that they had met around a game of craps. It wasn’t staring at the slot machines or scratch-tickets waiting for the casino to decide 
	that it wanted to give you some money. $16.8 million in revenue on every $1 million payout was the number he and Hank and cranked out.</p>
	<p>“I can’t believe this place… the numbers were right… there! The sevens!” Hank called out, louder than he really ought to be, as they stepped 
	through the exit doors. His dress shirt, no longer tucked in, was slovenly wrinked and had a stain from a martini. “It stopped, and then mysteriously 
	shifted to deny me the triple! You saw it!”</p>

About Me
--------

![A professional picture of me.](images/profile.png)

Programming. Design. Writing. Music. Art. These are the industrial pillars that video games are built on, and one day, I wish to master them all.

My name is Nathan Terrell. I'm a proud Coloradoan studying game design and development at the Rochester Institute of Technology. While I've been in this program for three years, I've been designing games for my entire life. The crafted projects you'll find below have evolved from the spreadsheets, stories, and digital art of my adolescence, which themselves spring from a childhood of poorly-organized lists and drawings on a clipboard. The building blocks of video games have been as much of a physical and intellectual engagement to me as a car to a mechanic or a bird to an ornithologist. On the occasions where I'm not making, playing, or thinking about video games, I enjoy philosophy and creative writing.
